Hi! I’m KV Aditya Srivatsa, a Research Assistant at the [Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI)](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/), where I collaborate with [Dr. Ekaterina Kochmar](https://ekochmar.github.io/about/) on cutting-edge research at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Reasoning, and Intelligent Tutoring Systems.

I hold a B.Tech in Computer Science and an MS in Computational Linguistics from IIIT Hyderabad, graduating as the department rank 1. For my master’s thesis, I worked with [Dr. Manish Shrivastava](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=sIvMnGQAAAAJ&hl=en) on advancing user-centered text simplification and dialogue disentanglement. This work extended into my role as a Research Associate under [Dr. Kamal Karlapalem](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KJR00_sAAAAJ&hl=en) as part of the [JP Morgan & Chase Faculty Research Award](https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/research-awards/faculty-research-awards-2021) project, where I focused on simplifying legal and banking documents for everyday users.

I also spent over two years as an Applied Research Engineer Intern at Apple, where I developed and maintained NLP pipelines for Apple Maps & Services. My contributions impacted products serving users across more than a dozen countries.

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to better bridge the gap between experts and novices in domains like education (teacher-student) and litigation (lawyer-client). Previously, I worked on enhancing the readability and searchability of domain-specific content. Now, I’m tackling the challenges of evaluating and improving how LLMs reason and communicate, with three main areas of interest:

  1. Diagnosing Reasoning Errors – How can LLMs better identify and explain mistakes in reasoning chains, pinpointing both the location and type of error?
  1. Challenging Reasoning Tasks – How do LLMs perform on complex problems, such as multi-step math word problems or linguistic puzzles, and where do they fall short?
  1. Generating Actionable Feedback – Can LLMs provide meaningful feedback for self-correction and facilitate effective teacher-student exchanges?

Ultimately, I aim to refine LLMs into tools that are not only intelligent but also reliable and insightful, capable of supporting users in learning, reasoning, and collaboration.

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

For more info
------
More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful. -->
